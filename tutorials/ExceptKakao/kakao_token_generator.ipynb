    "### `KaKao Talk` is strongly discouraged as an application of python `ExceptNotifier`.\n",
    "KakaoTalk is a very complex application that is mainly used for various businesses in Korea. It's very complex, the tokens have short lifetimes, and the application's dynamic consent and dependencies are very complex. Python ExceptNotifier takes reuse very seriously. Therefore, KakaoTalk, which is very inconvenient to set up initially, has an expiration date of tokens, and has various update errors, is not strongly recommended as an application that receives ExceptNotifier alarms. (Also, do not use KakaoTalk as it is confirmed that it does not support alarms in the case of the Send Me Message API.)"
