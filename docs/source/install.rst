Install
===============================================================================================
First we must make sure we have EXceptNotifier installed:

$ pip install ExceptNotifier

$ pip install exceptnotifier

For the purposes of this tutorial, the simpleble package, which we will be documenting, depends on another package named bluepy. In order for Sphinx to auto-generate documentation from our comments/docstrings, it must also be able to build our package, and thus we must have any dependencies installed and made visible to Sphinx. For this reason, and ONLY for this specific tutorial.
