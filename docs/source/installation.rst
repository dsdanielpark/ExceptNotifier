There are dependency modules that operate differently depending on the version of the Python package. A representative example is discord and discord.py, which can be branched and processed differently depending on the version. The QA test was conducted with version 3.9, and the Python version can also affect openai's API. If an error occurs, please create an issue on the official GitHub.
